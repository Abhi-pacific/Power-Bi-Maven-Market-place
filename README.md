The “Maven Market Report” is a Power BI project that provides a comprehensive view of sales data and financial metrics for various products and brands. It includes visualizations such as bar graphs, maps, and KPI indicators to offer insights into total transactions, profit margins, monthly transactions, and profits.

Here are the key components of the report:

Product Brands: A bar graph on the left side shows product brands along with their total transaction values, profit margins, and total profits.
KPIs: At the top center are KPIs displaying current month transaction, current month profit, and return rate, each compared against specific goals.
Total Transaction by Store City: Below the KPIs is a map showing transaction distribution across America with green bubbles indicating transaction volumes in different cities.
Total Transaction by Store Country: To the right of the map are two bar graphs indicating total transactions for USA and Mexico.
Weekly Revenue Trending: Below these visualizations is a line graph depicting revenue trends over time.
Revenue and Revenue Target: Adjacent to this line graph on its right is another circular graph showing revenue and revenue target.
This report seems to be a powerful tool for analyzing market performance and making informed business decisions. Please note that the actual data and metrics might vary based on your specific dataset and business needs.
